# my-blog
A full-stack blog management system with JWT authentication, built using Node.js/Express (backend) and React/Next.js (frontend). Authenticated users can create, edit, and delete their own blog posts, while the public can view all posts. Includes protected routes, a rich text editor, and role-based access control â€” all in a single monorepo.
